        Outline:
            The three drawings will be of the sun, earth, and moon (or some combination of three planets)
            rendered with Three.js using the sphere geometry covered in class, and textures from
            https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/. The elevation of earth and moon's mountains and
            valleys will also be rendered if possible. The viewer will be able to interact with the
            drawing with the orbital control from Three.js and through the arrow keys to move between
            the three drawings. Through this drawing, the viewer gets to experience a perspective of
            what the earth, moon, and sun look like from outside the earth. And hopefully the drawings
            will be able to somewhat convey the vastness of space, or rather the minuteness of the world
            that we live in. The three drawings relate to each other in that they all have the same
            setting of outer space. For the web api, (yet to be decided on) but most likely something
            like varying the rotation speed of the earth with a value returned from an api (possibly
            temperature or wind speed from a weather api). And maybe also the lighting of the earth too,
            such as changing the color temperature of the directional light based on the temperature.
            Something similar will be done for the other two drawings.
